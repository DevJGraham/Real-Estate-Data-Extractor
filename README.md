# Real Estate Data Extractor

## Overview

The Real Estate Data Extractor efficiently gathers data from the Allegheny County Real Estate Portal. Designed to extract key property details such as property address, owner's mailing address, sale date, and sale price, this tool allows users to input the street name and municipality (optional) to quickly collect comprehensive data across multiple entries. The collected data is then compiled into a CSV file, facilitating easy analysis and insight generation.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Automates the extraction of whatever data points are most valuable to the client, for example, Owner Mailing Address, Sale Date and Price, etc. 
- **Concurrency**: Employs Asyncio and Aiohttp to enhance data gathering efficiency through parallel processing.
- **Data Export**: Organizes and outputs the collected data into a structured CSV file for further use.

## What I Learned

Building the Real Estate Data Extractor enhanced my skills in:
- **Advanced Web Scraping**: Utilized Selenium, BeautifulSoup, XPath, and custom logic to extract data from dynamic content.
- **Data Exporting with Pandas**: Streamlined the conversion of raw data into structured CSV formats.
- **Optimized Data Collection**: Replaced browser-based scraping with asynchronous URL fetching, reducing overhead and improving speed.
- **Concurrency with Asyncio**: Managed parallel data retrieval tasks for efficient and scalable scraping.
- **Troubleshooting Dynamic Content**: Developed expertise in debugging and handling non-standard web structures.

These advancements not only enhanced technical capabilities but also honed analytical and problem-solving skills, preparing for complex data processing challenges in future roles.
